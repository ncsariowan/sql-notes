Gosh is Markdown so much better; I might start doing all my notes this way.

## SQL Keywords

### Select
`SELECT column1, column2… FROM table1`
`SELECT * FROM table1`

### Select Distinct
Only shows unique values

`SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2… FROM table1`

`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column1) FROM table1`

### Where
`SELECT column1 FROM table1 WHERE conditional1`

Ex:
`SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE column1='something'`
`SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE column1 BETWEEN 0 AND 60`
`SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE column1 IN ('One Value', 'Another Value')`
`SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE column1 LIKE '%s'` (patterns)

You can use `=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=` too. 

### And, Or and Not
`SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE conditional1 AND conditional2 AND ...`
`SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE conditional1 OR conditional2 OR...`
`SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE NOT conditional1`

### Order By
`SELECT column1, column2 ... FROM table1 ORDER BY column1, column2 ... ASC|DESC`

### Insert Into
`INSERT INTO table1 (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...)`

### Is Null and Is Not Null
`SELECT column1, column2... FROM table1 WHERE column1 IS NULL`
`SELECT column1, column2... FROM table1 WHERE column1 IS NOT NULL`

### Update
`UPDATE table1 SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE conditional1`

### Delete
`DELETE FROM table1 WHERE conditional1`

### Top and Limit
SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:
`SELECT TOP 

## Databases Notes
### Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
**Record** = **Entry** = **Row**
**Unique Key**: Each value must be unique
**Primary Key**: Key that doesn't have null values
**Foreign Key**: Entry in one table that serves as a primary key in another
### Normalizing Data
**First Normal Form**: Each entry should only have one piece of data in it 
**Second Normal Form**: Each field in a row should be fully dependent on a single key
**Third Normal Form**: All data in non-key columns should be independent of each other
